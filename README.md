#### Image

See <a href="/Dockerfile">`Dockerfile`</a> for the Docker image.

### No Docker

This section is a little more complicated, but will be better for some people.  

#### Instructions

- Clone the repo
  - ` git clone https://github.com/Freedeck/Freedeck.git `
- Download NPM packages
  - `npm i`
- Run the program!
  - `npm run start`
- Enjoy!

The moment you start Freedeck, you'll be put into a setup wizard, in the terminal. You'll also get a setup wizard for Companion when it launches.
