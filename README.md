### Instructions (Easily Advanced??)

For those who want the simplicity of the Installer, but need the complexity of the codebase.

- Follow the *Instructions (Easier Than Easy)*
- Now, you can go to your user directory, documents, Freedeck, then Freedeck again!
  - Let me break the command down for you.
  - `cd C:\Users\You\Documents\Freedeck\freedeck` (You need the last "freedeck"! That's the actual repo!)
- Kaboom! You can now open Freedeck in VSCode, NeoVim, or any other editor/IDE!

The moment you start Freedeck, a setup wizard will launch. Follow those instructions. Next, when Companion launches, you'll see another setup wizard. Follow those instructions.

From there, Freedeck is ready to use.
