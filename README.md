  - `cd C:\Users\You\Documents\Freedeck\freedeck` (You need the last "freedeck"! That's the actual repo!)

The moment you start Freedeck:

- a setup wizard will launch.  
  - Follow the on-screen instructions.  
- when the setup wizard closes, you'll see Companion.
  - It's like Step 2, you just pick your audio devices and then you're ready!

From there, Freedeck is ready to use.
